SORTING METHODS

Developed in 2020 for an academic project, this work was implemented in Java by developers Fernando Bretz, Igor Palhares and Paulo Rocha.

The main objective of the project is to analyze the performance of different sorting algorithms on vectors of varying sizes, extracted from files. To achieve this, 
we measured the execution time of each method, calculated the average time, and generated comparative graphs to illustrate the performance of each algorithm. 
Additionally, we provided the code used to test the algorithms.

Tested Sorting Methods:
- BubbleSort
- Mergesort
- Heapsort
- InsertionSort
- SelectionSort
- Quicksort

The tests were performed by importing the same files into all methods, using vectors of sizes 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, and 128000 elements. Each algorithm was responsible for sorting these vectors in three conditions: ascending order, descending order, and random order.
